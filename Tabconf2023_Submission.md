**Narrative Extract from "The Bitcoin Odyssey: A PLEBNET.DEV Developer's Quest for Sovereignty"**

_Chapter 3: The Forked Betrayal_

"Julien's encounter with Victor sent shockwaves through his core. He had always believed that
the Bitcoin community was built on trust and transparency, but now he saw the dark underbelly
that lurked beneath the surface. Victor and his accomplices sought to capitalize on the trust
people placed in Bitcoin, using their knowledge to create decepFve forks that mirrored the
original blockchain but with hidden alteraFons designed to benefit themselves."
